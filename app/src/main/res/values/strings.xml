        \n\n Here are some ideas
        \n\n Use images instead of colors and reveal the images.
        \n\n You can even create a picture memory game.
        \n\n Use one image and break it up into sections to reveal over time.
        \n\n Get rid of the text and buttons and just fill the screen with boxes.
        \n\n Implement one of Piet Mondrians Paintings

        \n\n Style the app to uniquely represent you and your personality.
